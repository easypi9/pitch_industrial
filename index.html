  <p class="line">Industrial subcontracting is still managed like a pre-digital process.</p>
  <p class="line">The bottleneck isn’t manufacturing capacity — it’s coordination and trust across multiple parties.</p>
  <p class="line">Supplier discovery is unstructured and relationship-driven (finding the right capability for a specific scope still depends on “who you know”)</p>
  <p class="line">Offers arrive in inconsistent formats hard to compare (procurement teams spend time normalizing information instead of making decisions)</p>
  <p class="line">Supplier verification is fragmented (capabilities, compliance and documentation are scattered and repeatedly re-checked)</p>
  <p class="line">Execution + documentation are spread across disconnected tools (no single operational thread from RFQ to close-out)</p>
  <p class="line">Decision-making is slow and opaque on both sides.</p>
  <p class="line">Buyers wait days or weeks for technically validated offers.</p>
  <p class="line">Suppliers spend days internally assessing feasibility — checking material availability, machine capacity, process compatibility, workforce load, deadline feasibility (DL), and pricing assumptions across disconnected systems and teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="text-block">
  <p class="line">Technical validation is manual and iterative.</p>
  <p class="line">Engineering, production planning, procurement, and management exchange multiple internal iterations before an offer can even be submitted.</p>
  <p class="line">Capacity visibility is unclear.</p>
  <p class="line">There is no real-time structured view of production windows, bottlenecks, or available manufacturing bandwidth.</p>
  <p class="line">Logistics, installation, service providers, and warehousing are coordinated separately , often only after award — creating downstream delays, cost overruns, and execution risk.</p>
  <p class="line line--label">Decision speed is constrained by:</p>
  <p class="line line--item">manual RFQ interpretation</p>
  <p class="line line--item">spreadsheet-based cost calculations</p>
  <p class="line line--item">repeated material and technology checks</p>
  <p class="line line--item">internal approval loops</p>
  <p class="line line--item">disconnected logistics coordination</p>
  <p class="line">As markets accelerate, slow coordination becomes structural disadvantage.</p>
  <p class="line line--label">The result:</p>

  <p class="line line--item">high internal labor cost per RFQ</p>
